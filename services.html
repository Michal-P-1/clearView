                For facade and window cleaning, we utilize two methods. If the
                facade is traditionally soiled, the drone applies a special
                solution by foaming it onto the facade at low pressure. If the
                buildings have not been cleaned for a long time, or are
                extremely dirty, the process involves cleaning the facade and
                windows using the pure water method.

                <br />
                <br />

                The pure water method simply involves using water treated with
                reverse osmosis, heated to 70 degrees, and applied under high
                pressure by the drone. This means that window cleaning is
                environmentally friendly because it is done without chemicals,
                and the windows stay cleaner over time. It also reduces the risk
                of surface damage, such as streaks caused by more traditional
                and hazardous manual cleaning methods.

                            Commercial window cleaning at heights can be very
                            time-consuming. We offer a new, more efficient, and
                            safer way to provide high-rise window cleaning,
                            which is considered faster, thereby reducing costs.

                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Modern buildings, including residential complexes,
                            office buildings, and commercial properties in
                            general, often have large glass surfaces. Due to
                            their height, design, and location, performing
                            regular maintenance can be time-consuming and
                            costly. These buildings often require work at
                            heights, which is expensive and carries risks.

                            <br />
                            <br />

                            Using a work drone is considered safe. Working at
                            heights can be dangerous, and utilizing this drone
                            technology eliminates the need for workers to
                            physically enter these heights and hazardous
                            environments. As a result, the foundations of this
                            technology are considered much safer when working in
                            hazardous environments.
